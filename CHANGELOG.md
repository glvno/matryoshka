# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Syncing with an FM-1 on firmware older than 1.2 now says to update it (with a button to the install panel),
  instead of failing with "the firmware refused the patch".
- The sidebar stays the same in Patch, Emu and Library; Get started, Audio on / Panic and MIDI are there in all three.
  Library's Patches, Assemblies, Presets and Community are tabs at the top. The logo takes you back to the canvas.
- 909 Kit XL has an arpeggiator (ARP, off until pressed) between its DRUMS track and the drum map, like every other XL.
- Make assembly (Ctrl/Cmd+G) works on a selection of assemblies alone: group two engines into one and promote just
  the controls you want.

## 1.3.2 — 2026-10-25

- FM-1: the footer's octave (= OCT =, OCT +, - OCT) changes as soon as you press OCT- / OCT+, not only once something
  else redraws the screen.

## 1.3.0 — 2026-10-24

### On the literal physical FM-1 device

- Big ol UI overhaul: 
  - Paging through params is 6x faster. 
  - Knobs respond 29x faster (lol). 
  - You no longer need a jeweler's loupe to know your current patch, device, or assembly. 
  - The UX on the FM1 sucked shit before -- sorry about that! I got swept up in patch editor feature creep and briefly forgot what my job was
 - CPU cycles down 8-13% on the FM-1; audio output is bit-identical to output before optimizations

### In the browser

- **SANDBOX MODE BABY!!!** If a patch is too big for the FM-1, the FM-1 becomes its
  controller as if it did fit on the device. 
  - I find that starting with something excessive and ambitious, then accommodating constraints later, results in cooler stuff than building reasonably for the jump, and the patch editor now suits that kind of workflow.
- **XL patches:** Every factory patch modeled after a synth whose architecture was too beefy to fit on the FM-1 now gets a browser-only version that is faithful to the OG architecture.
- **Community patches!!!** have their own Library section!!! Send me your most depraved patches, sickos!!!
- **MIDI clock out:** the editor can now keep multiple connected FM-1s in sync. Clock stopgap while I figure out Bluetooth vs GPL friction. I now understand why baudgirl is not FOSS 
- **OCT- / OCT+ on the FM-1 move the editor's octave too,** so the on-screen keyboard shows what you play.
- The FM-1 budget no longer reads a patch with an arpeggiator as half full. Now it reads it as half empty


## 1.2.2 — 2026-10-24

- **"update failed -5" explained:** the FM-1 was set up by M-VAVE's Official Open, and nothing was changed.
- **Sol 29N:** a new community patch after the Elta Music Solar 42N, playable on the FM-1.

## 1.2.1 — 2026-10-23

- **A refused return to V15 now says why,** and how to get back: nothing was erased.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-10-23

- **Presets:** store an assembly's values as a named preset and load it into any copy, in the editor and on the FM-1.
  Every factory engine comes with its own.
- **The environment page on the FM-1:** ENV lists every device in the patch, to pick, turn and open.
- **Arm several devices at once** to layer them on the keys, in the editor and on the FM-1.
- **Three new engines:** Scrounge, Meridian 8 and Perun 4, after the neutral labs Scrooge, the Landscape NOON and the
  Erica Synths PERKONS HD-01. Plus **<7PH**, a groove box patch.
- **An arpeggiator and a PATTERN track on every melodic factory patch,** on ARP.
- **A piano roll and a drum grid on the FM-1's SEQ page.**
- **The 909 Kit plays all eight rows:** five were silent.
- **No key press is lost while the FM-1's screen redraws.**
- **A battery gauge on the FM-1.**
- **New navigation:** PATCH | EMU | LIBRARY, and a Library that shows the browser and the FM-1 side by side.
- **Lire + Elvira,** the first community patch.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-10-22

- **Two new engines:** 8 Lire and Elvira 2, after the SOMA Lyra-8 and the neutral labs Elmyra 2.
- **Modules are named after the hardware they stand for:** Attenuverter, Slew limiter and so on. Patches load as before.
- **Share links keep big patches whole.**
- **With Live on, FM-1 knobs no longer make values jump.**

## 1.0.0 — 2026-10-21

The first release: a modular patch editor in the browser, and a firmware that turns the M-VAVE FM-1 into a player for its
patches.

- **44 module types,** and **assemblies** that make any group of them one card. 61 come with the editor.
- **17 factory patches,** from an init patch to instrument recreations and two drum kits.
- **Polyphony** of up to 8 voices on the FM-1, and **Steps** sequencer tracks of up to 64 steps.
- **The FM-1 plays your patches:** 64 slots, SELECT and ALGO page through the devices, K1..K4 turn the page in focus.
- **Live sync over USB:** edits, knobs and buttons go both ways.
- **USB MIDI and audio:** notes, CC and clock in, every control out, and the FM-1 as a 2-channel recording device.
- **Install and return to stock** from the browser.
- **Coming from Felucca:** installing overwrites Felucca's saved projects and samples. Save them first.

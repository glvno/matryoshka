# Matryoshka — notes for Codex

Nord Modular–style patchable synth for the **M-VAVE FM-1**, with a browser app to edit patches and flash firmware. Owner: morgulbrut. Read `README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `LICENSING.md` first.

## Decisions already made with the user

- **No FM engine and no Felucca features.** Only Felucca's flashing path and hardware layer (HAL, USB, update loader) are reused. GPL-3.0-only for the whole repo; keep Felucca's SPDX/copyright headers on copied files.
- Own repo (this one), not the stikka repos. The default branch is `main` (the work of `Codex/nord-modular-fm1-webapp-cikr6h` and the dependabot bumps, vite 8 / vitest 5, were merged into it); the `deploy` workflow publishes `main` to Cloudflare Pages (https://matry0shka.pages.dev/, `SITE_URL` in `web/src/site.ts`), and GitHub Pages serves only a forwarder (`deploy/github-pages-forward`). No PR unless asked.
- Aftermarket firmwares exist: Felucca (`hugelton/Felucca`, GPL-3.0, source at commit `a4d7ca2e`), Sloop (installer only, no source found). Felucca is the reference; its source is the only documentation of the hardware.

## State (milestone 1 done, pushed)

- `web/`: Vite + TS. `src/patch.ts` (data model, ordering, validation), `src/modules.ts` (12 module defs + DSP), `src/engine.ts` (block engine, 1..8 voices), `src/worklet.ts` + `src/audio.ts` (AudioWorklet, bundled via `?worker&url`), `src/editor.ts` (DOM cards + SVG cables), `src/flasher.ts` (UI over Felucca's `src/flasher/fm1ota.js`, `fm1pkg.js`), `src/presets.ts`, `src/input.ts`.
- `npm test` (vitest, 10 tests), `npm run build`, `npm run dev` all pass. The built app was smoke-tested in headless Chromium: audio worklet produces sound on key down, silent after release, cable drag/remove works.
- `firmware/hal`, `firmware/crt0.S`, `firmware/app.ld`, `tools/*` are copies from Felucca (`build.py` adapted, loader ID changed to `ota-FM-1_800`).

## Added since milestone 1 (web only, tests pass: 14)

- Preset `303 Acid`; osc `pw` (pulse width); LFO wave `S&H`.
- Every param has a CV input `<param>_cv` (`cvPort` in `modules.ts`): effective = base + mean(cv over block) * (max-min), clamped, applied per block in `Engine.applyCv`. Exception: module `fm1`.
- Module `fm1` ("FM-1 panel"): pitch/gate/vel plus knobs k1..k4 (sliders on the card). Buttons and the other 3 encoders were deliberately left out.
- A single-file HTML build was tried and reverted at the user's request; the build stays multi-file.
- Firmware build was attempted: blocked on macOS (no Docker, toolchain is Linux x86-64), no `firmware/src/`, no SDK files. The user moves to a Linux box, so step 1 below can run natively.

## Firmware build (works, not flashed)

- `nix develop` (flake.nix) sets `JIELI_TOOLCHAIN=~/.jieli/toolchain` and `AC79_SDK=~/.jieli/ac79-sdk`. Toolchain: `tools/get_toolchain.sh`; SDK: sparse clone of `cpu/wl82/tools` at tag `AC79NN_SDK_V1.2.1_2023-12-13` (the 3 files match the expected SHA-256). The prebuilt clang runs on NixOS via nix-ld.
- `python3 tools/build.py` builds `build/matryoshka.bin` (15 KB), `build/loader/ota.bin` and `build/matryoshka.fwsc` (identity `FM-1_800`) with no warnings; all checks pass.
- `firmware/src/` (bring-up): `modular.c` (single unit), `main.c` (reduced Felucca boot: boot-loop guard, OCT-/OCT+ 5 s UBOOT, OTA, UBOOT SysEx), `audio.c` (sine voice on MIDI notes), `font5x7.c`, plus Felucca's `usb.c`, `ota.c`, `ota_hw.c`, `storage_hw.c`, `lcd.c`, `libc.c` (ota_hw.c edited to use `text5x7`). Felucca source: `~/.jieli/felucca` at `a4d7ca2e`.
- build.py no longer runs `generate()` (the gen_*.py tools are not in this repo) and skips `size_fns.py` unless `FELUCCA_SIZE=1`.
- The sine/MIDI/LCD code has never run on hardware.

## Measured on device (flashing works, user-confirmed)

Benchmark (`firmware/src/bench.c`, numbers in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md): no FPU, float 40-70x slower than Q15 (osc 489 us vs 7 us per 128-frame block). **Decision: audio path fixed point only.** `tools/build.py` links `libcompiler-rt.a` from the toolchain; install with `nix develop -c python3 tools/fm1_install.py build/matryoshka.fwsc` (mido/rtmidi are in the flake; the tool asks for confirmation interactively).

## Engine port (done on the host, not yet measured on device)

- `firmware/src/engine.c` (+ `engine.h`, generated `defs.h`, `presets.h`, `dsp_tables.h`): fixed-point port of all 13 modules, 1..8 voices, Q16.16. `tools/golden.sh` (inside `nix develop`) compares it with `web/src/engine.ts`: 11 patches pass (rms error <= 3 % of reference rms; smooth patches ~0.1 %).
- Regenerate after changing `modules.ts` or `presets.ts`: `cd web && npm run export-defs` (defs.h, presets.h); tables: `python3 tools/gen_dsp_tables.py`. Binary patch format: `web/src/patchbin.ts` (type/port indices are append-only).
- **Verified on the FM-1 (M1-0.2): sound is clean.** 303 Acid costs 11 % of the audio budget (peak 12 %, ISR time per 128-frame half incl. key scan and USB). The 27 keys play F3..G5 (`fm1_in.notes`), the MASTER pot is a software gain read via ADC (square law, `master_q12`); output samples are 24-bit in the LOW bits of each I2S word (Q16 << 6, -6 dBFS ceiling), not left-justified as the HAL comment suggests.
- Device: audio ISR renders the engine; MIDI program change = factory patch, the CPU figure is no longer drawn (`eng_us_last`/`eng_us_max` remain).
- `firmware/src/bench.c` is only compiled with `-DM1_BENCH`.

## Patch transfer (M1-0.3, host-tested, NOT yet run on the device)

- SysEx protocol in `web/src/protocol.ts` (documented there) <-> `firmware/src/proto.c`; hooks and flash store in `main.c` / `patchstore.c`; browser side `web/src/device.ts` + toolbar in `index.html`/`main.ts`; terminal tool `tools/m1_link.py` (`info`, `upload build/golden/303-acid.m1p`, `param`, `store`, `note`, `bank` = write the 32 factory presets from `presets.h` into the flash bank, `bank-info`, `bank-clear`; the bank commands are untested on the device).
- First thing to do after flashing M1-0.3: `nix develop -c python3 tools/m1_link.py info`, then upload, param, store, power-cycle (the stored patch must come back: label `STORED PATCH`). Flash writes by the app (sectors 0x97000/0x98000) have never run on the device.

## Parameter inputs + matrix + module select (M1-0.6, host-tested; device UI not yet seen)

- Replaces the per-parameter `<param>_cv` inputs: two inputs `p1`, `p2` per module (not fm1/output) with attenuverters `att` (-1..1) and a matrix `map` (sources p1 p2 k1..k4 -> parameters). Model in `web/src/patch.ts` (`fixMatrix`, `defaultMap`, version 2, v1 migration), semantics in `engine.ts applyCv` and `engine.c apply_cv`, binary patch format 2 (`web/src/patchbin.ts`: +8 byte attenuverters +6 byte masks per module that has inputs), protocol cmd 0x21 ATT.
- Device: SELECT (encoder 0) steps through the modules, K1..K4 change the parameters of the selected module per its matrix column (fm1 module: k1..k4 as before). LCD shows module name, the four knob rows and the P1/P2 attenuverters + assignments. Patch size limit 3072 B. Old stored patches (format 1) are refused at boot -> factory patch 0.
- Found and fixed with the golden test: the filter had a DC offset at low cutoff (truncation bias in Q16 states); states are now Q20 and products rounded.
- M1-0.7: the `midi` module is gone. Keys and USB MIDI feed the one voice, which only the `fm1` (FM-1 panel) module outputs (pitch/gate/vel + k1..k4); old patches with `midi` load as `fm1`. Binary patch format is now 3 (type indices moved). A patch needs an FM-1 panel module to be playable.
- Factory patch "FM-1 Panel synth" uses p1/p2 of filter and delay with explicit matrices.

## Preset bank + 32 factory presets (M1-0.8, host-tested; flash bank not yet run on the device)

- `web/src/presets.ts`: 32 factory presets (5 original + 27 generated with `voice()` / `toOut()` helpers, all playing from the FM-1 panel module). `cd web && npm run export-defs` regenerates `firmware/src/presets.h` (all 32 are compiled into the firmware as fallback).
- Bank in flash: `firmware/src/slotstore.c` (32 sectors at 0xA0000), protocol commands SLOT 0x13 / SLOT_ERASE 0x14 / SLOT_INFO 0x15 (reply 0x42), web page `web/src/bank.ts` (tab "Presets", list stored in localStorage `matryoshka.bank`). Device: encoder 6 (PRESET) and program change step through the bank (or the factory list if the bank is empty); boot loads the STOREd patch if any, else entry 0.
- Hazard I hit: never `git checkout <file>` on a file with uncommitted work (I lost presets.ts once and had to rewrite it).

## M1-0.9 (host-tested; device UI/buttons not yet seen)

- Buttons: OCT- (id 0) / OCT+ (id 1) octave shift of the keys, SAVE (id 9) stores the state (patch + octave + selected module + preset) via `m1_store`; unused buttons show nothing (ids from Felucca's panel table: only PLAY/REC were measured, SAVE may differ: check on the device).
- LCD rewritten in `firmware/src/ui.c`; preview without a device: `nix develop -c tools/ui_preview.sh out.png PRESET [MODULE [OCTAVE]]`. Font now has + % & > = ( ) ? ! # * < , _ '.
- Choice names / units / input names / log flags are generated into `defs.h` (`export-defs.ts`).
- New module `reverb`; patch binary format 4; filter cutoff is logarithmic (`ParamDef.log`); each preset in `presets.ts` ends with plain `wire(kb, 'kN', module, 'p1'|'p2')` lines for K1..K4 (the module's `add` has the base value, `map` and `att`; the panel's `add` the k1..k4 start positions; `voice()` returns `[vca, adsr]` and takes optional opts for both) (rules in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
- Pool use is 318 KB of 368 KB (signal buffers, 2 delays, 2 reverbs, the LCD picture buffer).

## Filter rework (host-tested, golden 42 patches pass; not flashed)

- Module `filter` (label now just "Filter", it was "SVF filter"): outputs in this order `lp24`, `lp12` (was `lp`, old patches are migrated in `validatePatch`), `bp`, `hp`, `mix`; input `morph` (after `cv`); params `track` (check box, `ParamDef.toggle`; cutoff follows the played pitch 1 oct/oct, C4 = cutoff as set, per block) and `morph` (0 = 24 dB LP .. 1 = HP, plus the input, clamped). lp24 = a second SVF stage on lp12, damped (k = sqrt 2), so the resonance comes from stage 1. `hp` is the 12 dB high pass of stage 1.
- Binary patch format is now 6 (5: port indices after `cv` moved, 2 new params; 6: filter output order); old stored patches fall back to factory patch 0.

## Panel and LCD pass (host-previewed / built, not flashed)

- LCD: top bar = preset name only (black on `C_ACC`, messages replace it for 1 s); module page like the arp pages (`text_mid` = 1.5x font, 9 px per char), value bars on every knob row (`param_bar`), patch diagram as a vertical strip at x 164..240. `screen_idle` no longer blanks the screen (page switches still do); `put_param` terminates its string.
- Buttons (main.c): OCT- 0, OCT+ 1, FX 2, SEL 3, ENV 4, LFO 5, EDIT 6, GLO 7, HOME 8 (FM-1 panel page), SAVE 9, ARP 10, SEQ 11, PLAY 12, REC 13; unused ones do nothing. HOME/ARP/SEQ/LFO glow dimly; octave LEDs breathe with speed by |octave| (HAL `fm1_br_step`, one shared speed, PLAY's green LED breathes while the arp runs).
- TRS MIDI in: `firmware/src/midi_uart.c` (Felucca's parser), polled in the TIMER5 ISR; never tried with a real source (TRS type A/B unknown).
- USB product string is `Matryoshka` (was `Modular-1` before 2026-10-21; macOS may keep showing a cached name); host tools match felucca|matryoshka|modular|fm-1. Boot splash is off (`-DM1_SPLASH`).

## Flash tab (simplified)

- One click installs the firmware bundled with the app: `tools/build.py` then `cd web && npm run firmware` copies `build/matryoshka.fwsc` to `web/public/firmware/matryoshka.fwsc` + `matryoshka.json` (version, product, sha256; git-ignored). If the FM-1 is sitting in its update loader from an interrupted install, the same button finishes that write. "Return to stock" needs the official `FM-1.fwsc`; "Install another package" takes any `.fwsc` that carries the loader. The "combine the official V15 with an app.bin" step is gone (`buildFeluccaPackage` is no longer used by the UI).

## Polyphony (host-tested, golden 45 patches pass; not flashed) — device controls superseded by the merge section at the end

- `Patch.voices` (1..8, absent = mono), binary header byte 3 (was reserved 0; firmware reads 0 as 1, the patch version stays 6 so older firmware plays such patches mono). `voiceSplit` (patch.ts) = the per-voice set, `voicesOf`, `VOICE_PORTS`, `SHARED_TYPES`; the rules are in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md "Polyphony". The control is a `voices` row on the Main card (`Editor.voicesRow`), `×N` badge on per-voice cards (editor.ts), `deviceBudget` / `DEVICE` in patchbin.ts (the row shows the buffer count, goes red, and main.ts puts it in the status line when the FM-1 would refuse the patch). Device: GLO button = `PAGE_GLO` 4 (`glo_ui.c`, `glo_view_draw`), K1 -> `voices_set` (main.c: header byte 3 of `m1_cur`, `eng_load`, rollback on error), `eng_voices()`, Main page title shows the count.
- engine.ts: `Inst` per voice, `VoiceState` allocator (`noteOn` / `noteOff`), `voiceNotes()` / `nvoices` for tests. engine.c: `inst_t` in `inst_pool` (`.pool`, `ENG_MAX_INST` 128), `node_t` = `inst0, ninst`, `voice_t E.vc[]`, `cur_v`, `port_poly` / `buf_of`, `eng_voices()`. Module functions take `(const node_t *nd, inst_t *it, n)`. `MAX_SUM` 192, `MAX_SRC` 512. Load errors: -6 out of buffers / sources, -7 out of instances.
- The engine's sample type is `esig_t` now (`sig_t` is a typedef in macOS `<signal.h>`; `tools/golden.sh` therefore runs on macOS with plain gcc/clang + node). `tools/ui_preview.sh` runs on macOS too: ui.c's picture buffer uses `UI_POOL` (empty on the host, `.pool` in modular.c); the preview takes an optional 9th argument POLY (after PAGE, ARP_STEP, MENU_TAB, MANUAL_LINE).
- CPU per voice on the device: not measured. Memory added: `inst_pool` about 16 KB in the pool, `sum_src` 2 KB in .bss.
- Not done: INFO reply without `ENG_MAX_VOICES`, unison. Button id 7 = GLO is from Felucca's panel table and unmeasured, like the other named buttons.

## Not verified — do not claim otherwise

- The flash tab and installer have never run against a real FM-1 in this project.
- Polyphony has only run on the host (vitest + golden); the firmware with it has not been built with the JieLi toolchain nor flashed.
- FM-1 CPU clock, RAM and flash sizes are unknown. A single reverse-engineering write-up (not seen first-hand) names the chip JieLi AC791N / pi32v2. Memory map hints: `firmware/app.ld`, `tools/build.py` (app slot 0x8DFBC bytes).
- Whether `buildFeluccaPackage` (patch an app.bin into the user's official V15) also swaps in the Felucca loader. Read `web/src/flasher/fm1pkg.js` `Package.setApp` before relying on it.
- Product identity `FM-1_800` (`PRODUCT` in `web/src/flasher.ts` and `tools/build.py`) is a choice, not something the device mandated; it must match `FELUCCA_ID` in the firmware build.

## How the flash path works (from reading Felucca)

SysEx over USB MIDI. The device *pulls* blocks: it sends read requests (cmd 0x30) for addresses in a "logical image" (package minus 20 marker bytes after each of the first 20 32-byte blocks); the host answers with `response()`. Step 1: running firmware checks the package (finish addr `0xE0000000`) and stages the loader; step 2: the loader (`usb_hid_ota.bin`, marker `FELUCCA-LOADER-1`) reads everything and writes flash (finish `0xF0000000`), then reboots. Identity handshake `F0 00 32 45 00 00 00 40 7F F7`; upgrade command `F0 22 24 35 7F F7`. Recovery: an interrupted write leaves the device as `ota-FM-1_*` ("WL80UBOOT" USB name); run the install again. Return to stock: official V15 file, sha256 `db1642b2…edb8a`. Hold OCT− + OCT+ for 5 s on a running Felucca to enter UBOOT.

## Next steps (in order)

1. (done, see above) **Get the toolchain.** `tools/get_toolchain.sh` (downloads from `pkgman.jieliapp.com`) and the AC79 SDK (`Gitee Jieli-Tech/fw-AC79_AIoT_SDK`, tag `AC79NN_SDK_V1.2.1_2023-12-13`; needs `cpu/wl82/tools/uboot.boot`, `cfg_tool.bin`, `cfg/eq_cfg_hw.bin`). These hosts were blocked in the cloud sandbox but should work on the user's machine. Linux x86-64 native; macOS uses Docker (`JIELI_DOCKER`). Env: `JIELI_TOOLCHAIN`, `AC79_SDK`.
2. (built, untested on device) **Hello-world firmware** in `firmware/src/` (`main.c` etc.): boot on the Felucca HAL, LCD text, sine out, identity `FM-1_800`. Reuse Felucca's `main.c` boot order, `fm1_cstart`, `usb.c` (MIDI + the OTA request handling in `ota.c`/`ota_hw.c` must stay so the device can be re-flashed!), `audio.c`, `lcd.c`. Strip everything engine/UI related. Adapt `tools/build.py` (it compiles only `firmware/src/felucca.c` as a single unit including the other `.c` files, and runs `mmio_check`: register access only inside `hal/`).
3. Run `tools/build.py`, flash with `web/` flasher or `tools/fm1_install.py`. Keep the official `FM-1.fwsc` handy for return-to-stock. Test the recovery path (interrupt a write) deliberately before trusting anything.
4. (done on host) Port the engine to fixed-point C; golden-vector test against `web/src/engine.ts`. Measure CPU on device (Felucca shows CPU load in MENU > SYSTEM > INFO; its `tests/target_budget.py` is a reference).
5. Patch transfer over SysEx, panel mapping. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Gotchas

- **Chromium aborts the whole browser (SIGILL) in `midi::MidiManager::SetInputPortState`** (its ALSA Web MIDI backend, Chromium 151 on this NixOS box; `coredumpctl list` shows a series) when MIDI ports change while any page holds MIDI access, e.g. the FM-1 re-enumerating after a reset or during a firmware update, or other programs (`fm1_install.py`, `m1_link.py`: rtmidi/ALSA clients) coming and going. The web app therefore requests MIDI only on a click (Enable MIDI keyboard, Connect FM-1, the flasher) and has Release MIDI (reload). Prefer `tools/fm1_install.py` for flashing; close the app's tab before running CLI tools. Headless Chromium runs I started also dump core when killed.

- Never flash untested firmware that lacks Felucca's OTA handling; that removes the way back (apart from the loader/stock path).
- `pkill -f "<pattern>"` inside a Bash tool call matches the shell itself; use `pgrep`+PID or a pidfile.
- Web MIDI + SysEx needs Chrome/Edge and https or localhost.
- Engine buffers are 128 frames; modules read `ctx.n` (≤128), not `BLOCK`.
- Keep patch-format changes in `patch.ts` and update `validatePatch`, presets and tests together.

## FM oscillator (host-tested, golden 47 patches pass; not flashed)

- `osc` parameter `fb` (0..1, operator feedback, pi per unit of the two-sample average at 1) and an FM mode: with `pm` connected (index > 0) or `fb` > 0 the oscillator runs 2x oversampled with a polyphase allpass half-band decimator (same Q16 coefficients in `modules.ts` and `engine.c`, see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md "FM oscillator"). The plain path is untouched.
- Binary patch format is now 7 (the osc record has 7 parameters, `MAX_PAR` 7); old stored patches fall back to factory patch 0. Golden adds `osc-feedback` and `fm-2op`.
- Measured in the reference engine: aliasing of bright FM notes down 9..13 dB to about -41 dB; the decimated signal overshoots the level by up to ~1.4x, so a carrier at level 1 straight into the output can clip. `inst_t.s.osc` grew to 13 words (feedback history, pm interpolation, decimator states).

## Assemblies (editor only, browser-tested)

- `web/src/assembly.ts` (model, no DOM), `web/src/assemblies.ts` (library page, localStorage `matryoshka.assemblies`, factory set from `web/src/assemblies/*.json` via `import.meta.glob`), `editor.ts` (selection: shift-click / rubber band; container cards; expanded frames; membership by drag; snapshot undo). `Patch.assemblies` is an optional overlay; the engine, encoder, protocol and firmware ignore it, old editors keep it as an unknown field. Tests: `assembly.test.ts` (12).
- Factory assemblies: `web/scripts/gen-assemblies.ts` defines thirteen of them as small patches (grid positions, cables, exposed ports with `also` for merged gates, promoted parameters) and writes `web/src/assemblies/*.json`; `voice.json` and `echo.json` are kept as files. `assembly.test.ts` lists the names, inserts every one and plays it. The operator and the drums use the level/rate envelope, the subtractive voices keep the ADSR.
- Class names: `.pin` is the parameter-input row (pins), the expose / promote toggle button is `.tog`.

## Sync, glide, shaper, spread (host-tested, golden 49 patches pass; not flashed)

- `osc` / `lfo` input `sync` (rising edge restarts the phase), modules `glide` (one-pole slew, Q24 state in C) and `shape` (soft / hard / fold), panel output `spread` (-1..1 per voice, in `VOICE_PORTS` and `port_poly`). Appended to `ALL` in `modules.ts` so type indices stay; binary format 8. Golden adds `sync-glide-shape` and `spread` (3 voices).
- Lesson: a Q16 one-pole with a small coefficient stalls about 1 % short of its target (the step rounds to 0); keep such states in Q24 / Q30 as the ADSR does.


## Level/rate envelope, string, wavetable, chorus (host-tested, golden 53 patches pass; not flashed)

- Modules `env` (DX7 level / rate envelope), `string` (Karplus-Strong, `exc` input, 8 per patch, `str_pool`), `wavetable` (banks from `tools/gen_wavetables.py` -> `web/src/wavetables.json` + `firmware/src/wt_tables.h`; rerun the script after changing the recipes), `chorus` (shared, stereo, one per patch). Appended to `ALL`; binary format 9 (also: u16 matrix masks).
- The string loop is clamped to ±2 in both engines (a steady `exc` would grow by 1 / (1 − g)); its int16 line uses error feedback. Falling `env` segments end after `r` (not when within 1e-4 like the ADSR decay), else the next segment starts about 2 r late.
- Pool: about 10 KB free after this batch (numbers in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). The LCD colours of new types go in `TYPE_COLOR` (ui.c), or the module page draws them black.

## Sequencer, clock divider, S&H, quantizer, pulse (host-tested, golden 55 patches pass; not flashed)

- Modules `seq` (10 params: s1..s8, len, dir; rest = step at −1), `clkdiv` (out / d2 / d4 / d8, reset), `sh` (hold / track), `quant` (scales in `SCALES` in modules.ts and engine.c: keep both lists in the same order), `pulse`. Appended to `ALL`; MAX_PAR is 10 now (inst_t.eff grew by 3 words).
- A square LFO is the clock in tests and golden kits (rising edge at sample 0 because the square starts high); a reset edge on the same sample as a clock edge wins.
## Pan, crossfade, vowel, phaser, digitizer, noise colour (host-tested, golden 52 patches pass; not flashed)

- Modules `pan` (in, pos → l, r; equal power), `xfade` (a, b, pos → out), `vowel` (three formant band passes, position per block), `phaser` (four allpasses, triangle sweep per block, feedback), `crush` (bits / rate reduction); `noise` got a `color` parameter after `level` (color 0 = unchanged output). Appended to `ALL`; formulas in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md. `inst_t` union grew: `vow` (6 words), `phs` (10 words); `MAX_IN` / `MAX_OUT` / `MAX_PAR` are unchanged (6 / 8 / 7). Golden adds `pan-xfade` (3 voices), `vowel-phaser`, `crush-color`.
## Assemblies: merged ports, placement, nesting (browser-tested)

- `PortRef.also` = merged container inputs; `AssemblyInst.children` = nesting (MAX_DEPTH 3); `freeSpot` = placement. Model in `assembly.ts` (tests in `assembly.test.ts`, 18), editor glue in `editor.ts` (`mergeTools`, `nesting`, `moveTree`, `containers` map). Drops into a frame are judged by the card header (`HEAD_Y`), not the card centre: cards are tall.
- Verified in Chrome with synthetic pointer events (real drags cannot be generated by the automation): merge / split, cable to a merged jack and its removal, insert placement, nesting by drag, exposing a child's merged port on the parent, saving and re-inserting a nested definition, undo.
## Delay sync / ping-pong (host-tested, golden pass; not flashed)

- Module `delay`: inputs `in`, `clk`; outputs `out`, `r`; params `time`, `fb`, `mix`, `sync` (toggle), `pingpong` (toggle). Sync: the same `time` knob picks a note length (range split in `DELAY_DIVS`, shortest first: 1/16T .. 1/1, shared with the LFO's `div`; `ParamDef.altText` shows the name, LCD special case in `ui.c`, `delay_div()` in engine.c). Tempo = the last 24 pulses of `clk` (the Main module's clock, 24 ppqn), smoothed; 120 bpm until a clock has come in. Ping-pong: one buffer split in two halves, so the time is limited to ~525 ms then; `out` = left, `r` = right (without ping-pong `r` = `out`); `fb` and `mix` apply to both sides. Binary patch format 8.

## Main clock output (host-tested, golden pass; not flashed)

- Module `fm1` (Main) has a gate output `clock` after `k4` (appended, patch format unchanged). Source: the arpeggiator's 24 ppqn tick while `arp_play`, else MIDI clock (0xF8 from USB or TRS; 0xFC mutes until 0xFA/0xFB), else no output. `eng_clock_tick()` counts ticks; `m_fm1` / `Engine.voice.clock` turn a block that saw a tick into a pulse over its first half (block-quantized, ticks within one block merge). Browser: Web MIDI 0xF8/0xFA/0xFB/0xFC via `input.ts` -> worklet `clock` / `clockrun`.

## Two voices (host-tested, golden + arp tests pass; not flashed, CPU not measured)

- Bi-timbral: the engine has `ENG_VOICES` = 2 independent patches (`eng_t EV[]`, `E` = the selected one via `eng_voice_select`; `eng_render` mixes both and restores the pointer, the clock `clk_ticks` is shared). Per voice pool: 80 buffers, 1 delay, 1 reverb (was 160/2/2 for the one patch; same total pool, 323660 B; a patch with two delays or reverbs no longer loads, no preset uses them).
- SEL (button 3) switches the voice that keys, MIDI, knobs, LCD (bar shows `1 NAME` / `2 NAME`), program change and editor uploads act on; the SEL LED is lit on voice 2; notes held on the old voice end. Per-voice panel state is in `vs[]` (ui.c, macros `sel`, `cur_preset`, `patch_label`, `load_err`), the patch copy in `m1_curv[]` (proto.c). One arpeggiator per voice (`AV[2]`, `arp_p` = the selected voice's; PLAY and the arp pages act on it; the clock output follows voice 1's arp, else voice 2's, else MIDI); voice 2's scale is always voice 1's (the scale knob is refused there).
- Storage: see "Saved state" below. Editor STORE is refused while voice 2 is selected.
- LCD accent (`C_ACC`): orange on voice 1, purple (0xA19F) on voice 2; preset names are per voice (`label_buf[]`); the module colours in the patch picture are unchanged.
- Both voices rendering doubles the audio ISR time: measure on the device (`eng_us_max`).

## Mixer page + settings menu (host-previewed / built, not flashed)

- `firmware/src/menu.c` (included after `arp_ui.c`): GLO opens the mixer (`PAGE_MIXER` 4): K1 / K2 the level of voice 1 / 2 (percent, square law, `eng_voice_gain`), the F#3 (OP1) and G#3 (OP2) keys mute voice 1 / 2 and play no notes (`keys_poll`, `MIX_KEYS`). HOME held 0.7 s opens the settings menu (`PAGE_MENU` 5, Felucca style: ALGO steps the tabs DISPLAY / CONTROL / MIDI / SYSTEM, PRESET or SELECT the rows, K1..K4 or OCT-/OCT+ the value; HOME tap or hold closes). HOME now acts on release (tap = go to Main).
- Rows: LEDS, CPU IN BAR, KNOB ACCEL, OCTAVE, MIDI TO (selected / voice 1 / voice 2, notes only; program change stays on the selected voice), CLOCK IN, PROG CHANGE, VERSION, CPU PEAK, UPDATE MODE (OCT+ twice within 3 s -> UBOOT). Settings are `cfg` (ui.c); they and the mixer levels / mutes are saved by SAVE in the upper bits of `ps_state[0]` (`state_pack` / `state_unpack` in main.c; bit 15 marks a record that has them).
- The top bar shows the name at the left and the CPU load at the right (`cpu_pct`: peak ISR time of the last 0.5 s in % of the 2.9 ms half buffer, `cpu_poll`).

## Saved state + defaults (built, not flashed)

- SAVE (and the editor's STORE) writes the whole panel state as one blob into the patch store (`blob_build` in main.c; sectors 0x97000 / 0x98000, `PS_MAX` 3840 B): both voices' patches as they run (parameter edits included), both arpeggiators' settings (`arp_pack`, transport not saved), plus in the header words the octave, menu settings and mixer levels / mutes (`state_pack`), each voice's selected module and preset. Boot: `boot_blob`; a record from before (a bare patch, first byte 0xA1) still loads as voice 1. Too big for the sector: `ERROR`. RAM .bss is now 60 KB of 72.
- MENU > SYSTEM > DEFAULTS (OCT+ twice within 3 s): settings, mixer, arps, octave back to the defaults, voice 1 = preset 0, voice 2 = preset 1, and the stored state is erased (`defaults_now`, `ps_erase`).

## MIDI channels per voice, LED modes, mute LEDs (built, not flashed)

- `cfg.ch[2]`: voice 1 / 2 listen to their own MIDI channel (menu rows V1 / V2 CHANNEL, 0 = omni, defaults 1 and 2; both on the same channel = both play). Notes, CC 123 and program change go to the voices whose channel matches (`midi_drain`); program change loads into that voice. The panel keys still play the selected voice. MENU > MIDI TO is gone.
- `cfg.leds`: OFF / DIM LOW / DIM HIGH (`fm1_led_dim_level`, default dim high). Channels and LED mode are saved in a 3 byte tail of the state blob (after the two patches); the old bits 8 and 13..14 of `ps_state[0]` are no longer used.
- The F#3 / G#3 key LEDs are lit while voice 1 / 2 is muted (`mix_apply`), on every page.

## Four voices, LED levels (built, host tests + golden pass; not flashed, CPU not measured) — the per-voice memory slices were replaced by shared pools, see the merge section

- `ENG_VOICES` = 4 (engine.h): four independent patches, SEL cycles 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4, colours orange / purple / cyan / green (`VOICE_COLOR`, `C_ACC`), one arpeggiator each (`AV[4]`, scale of voices 2..4 = voice 1's), per voice MIDI channel (defaults 1..4), mixer rows K1..K4, mute keys F#3 G#3 A#3 C#4 = OP1..OP4 (`MIX_KEY_BIT`; OP3/OP4 positions are a guess), mute LEDs on those keys. The clock output follows the lowest voice whose arp runs.
- Memory: to fit four engines, per voice 24 modules, 128 cables, 40 signal buffers, one delay of `DELAY_LEN` 23000 samples (521 ms, the TS reference engine uses the same length now; the old 1.05 s did not fit), one reverb; `M1_PATCH_MAX` 2048. RAM region of app.ld is 24 KB, pool 408 KB (everything big is `ENG_POOL`: `EV`, `m1_curv`, the staging buffers). Pool headroom is 10 KB (build.py wants >= 8 KB). Preset 27 Drone's delay was 700 ms, now 500. The editor's HELLO reply reports 24 modules / 128 cables / 1 delay.
- Saved state blob version 2 (4 patches, 4 arps, tail with channels, LED mode, mixer levels and mutes); version 1 and bare-patch records are still read. Word 1 of the record holds one selected-module byte per voice, word 2 one preset byte per voice. Boot shows STATE RESTORED (or RESTORE FAILED when a record was there but did not load).
- LEDs: OFF / DIM LOW (the old glow, `FM1_LED_DIM_NS` 3.2 us) / DIM HIGH (`FM1_LED_DIM_HI_NS` 8 us, the tick waits the rest of the pulse); `fm1_led_dim_level(0|1|2)`.

## Loading screen (flashed in 1.0.1; not seen on the display by Codex)

- The boot splash is always on now: `splash_draw` right after `lcd_init`, then `boot_step(what)` prints `LOADING INPUT / AUDIO / USB / MIDI / STATE / VOICE n` and a bar (accent colour) while `fm1_main` and `patch_boot` run; it stays up at least `SPLASH_MS` = 5 s (the bar is the elapsed time; after loading the line reads READY; meanwhile `midi_drain` and `host_poll` (editor SysEx, M-UPGRADE, UBOOT SysEx) run, so hosts are answered from the start). The OCT- + OCT+ 5 s UBOOT hold counts from the end of the splash (`t_btn`). While `booting` is set (ui.c) `screen_idle` draws nothing, so the page does not flash through; after `patch_boot` the screen is cleared and the page plus the bar are drawn, and the restore note (STATE RESTORED / RESTORE FAILED) comes from `boot_msg`. The old `M1_SPLASH` define is gone. Host preview sets `booting = 0`.

## Manual tab (flashed in 1.0.1; not seen on the display by Codex)

- The settings menu has a fifth tab MANUAL (`menu.c`, text in `manual.c`): controls, MIDI mapping, editor link, memory limits, one scrollable page (SELECT or PRESET scrolls; PRESET only steps patches outside the menu, ALGO changes tab, OCT buttons do nothing there). Lines are `MANUAL[]` entries, first character = style (`#` heading, ` ` text, `~` dim), at most 35 characters, capitals only (no `;` in the font). Keep it in step with the buttons, `midi_drain` and the limits. Preview: `tools/ui_preview.sh out.png 1 0 0 5 0 4 <first line>`.

- Wording: in user-visible text (LCD manual, web app) a stored sound is a "patch", not a "preset"; only the hardware PRESET knob keeps its name. Identifiers (`PRESETS`, `preset_load`, `#presets` tab id, file names) are unchanged.

## Merge with upstream main 1.0.2 (host-tested: vitest 86, golden 65, arp + proto tests, LCD preview; NOT built with the JieLi toolchain, not flashed)

- Upstream's four **voices** = four patches (`EV[ENG_VOICES]`, SEL, mixer, per-voice MIDI channel, blob state). This branch's polyphony (`Patch.voices`, 1..8) is kept per patch; the firmware calls those **notes** (`pv_t`, `ENG_MAX_POLY`, `eng_poly()`; `voices_set` became `poly_set`). Rules and numbers in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md "Voices and the shared pools".
- **Shared pools with owners** (engine.c): `inst_own[]`, `buf_own[]`, `dly_own[]`, `rev_own[]`, `str_own[]`, `ch_own[]`; `eng_load` frees the loading voice's slots, then `slot_take` / `slots_take`. Sizes: 128 buffers, 96 instances, 4 delays (23000 samples = 521 ms, as the web engine), 2 reverbs, 6 strings, 1 chorus; per voice 32 modules, 192 cables, MAX_SUM 128, MAX_SRC 256, patch 3072 B. Stand-in build (clang `--target=riscv32-unknown-elf -fno-integrated-as -S`, the HAL's inline asm cannot be assembled on macOS; `scratchpad/sizes.sh` idea: sum the `.size` directives of `.pool`) says 408.5 KB of 417.8 KB; it overestimated upstream's 1.0.2 by about 7 KB against build.py, so expect ~16 KB real headroom. Tune the `#define`s at the top of engine.c, `DEVICE` in patchbin.ts and the MEMORY lines of manual.c together.
- **Ports / format:** Main outputs `pitch gate vel k1..k4 clock spread` (clock shared by the notes, `port_poly`; spread per note). LFO inputs `clk`, `reset` (this branch's `sync` input renamed: `validatePatch` converts cables, `gen-assemblies.ts` and golden kits updated; osc / wavetable keep `sync`). Delay as upstream (clk, r, sync, pingpong). Binary format 10; `ENG_PATCH_VERSION` 10.
- **Panel:** GLO = mixer (upstream); ALGO on the mixer page steps the selected voice's polyphony (`poly_set`, MONO / POLY n in the rows and the Main page title). `glo_ui.c` is gone. Manual MEMORY lines list the shared limits. HELLO reply says 32 modules / 192 cables / 4 delays. Version strings `M1-1.1.0-dev` / `1.1.0-dev` (bump at release as upstream does).
- Editor: `paramRow` got upstream's `altText` (synced delay time as a note length) through `refreshers`; tabs are "Patches" + "Assemblies"; `Engine.clockTick` / `clockRun` set `clock` on every note's `Voice`.
- Fixed on the way: dev's main.c used `voices_set` before its definition (the JieLi toolchain never saw it); upstream's `vgain[]` initialised only two of four voices (harmless, `mix_apply_all` runs at boot).
- Hazard: `git merge` auto-merged several upstream fragments into engine.c (`buf_pool[VOICE_NO]`, `eng_clock_tick`, the voice API at the end, the delay's state struct) without conflict markers; check the whole file, not only the hunks, after a merge there.
- `web/public/firmware/matryoshka.fwsc` / `.json` are upstream's 1.0.2 package (CI rebuilds it for Pages); not rebuilt here.

## Handoff

- `docs/HANDOFF.md` (2026-10-13): the decisions after the upstream merge (one-voice build via `ENG_VOICES`, one delay + one reverb, granular budget, feature order) and the plan for the first new modules. Read it before continuing that work.

## One-voice build switch (handoff step 1, done 2026-10-13; host-tested, NOT built with the JieLi toolchain, not flashed)

- `ENG_VOICES` (engine.h) defaults to 1; `M1_VOICES=4 python3 tools/build.py` and `M1_VOICES=4 tools/golden.sh | arp_test.sh | ui_preview.sh` build the four-voice panel. Pool sizes follow the count (`#if ENG_VOICES == 1` at the top of engine.c: 255 buffers, 128 instances, 1 delay, 1 reverb, 8 strings, 1 chorus; else 126 buffers, 92 instances, 4 delays, 2 reverbs, 6 strings). `ENG_VOICE_INIT(a, b, c, d)` makes per-voice initialisers (arp.c `ARP_INIT`, menu.c, ui.c, main.c, engine.c `vgain`).
- Panel with one voice: SEL does nothing (LED off), no voice number in the top bar, the mixer has one row `K1 LEVEL (OP1: MUTE)`, the MIDI tab one `MIDI CHANNEL` row (`CH_TAB`, hidden rows have tab `MT_NONE`; the menu walks rows by `menu_row_at` / `menu_pos`, not `first + r`), loading line `PATCH`, manual text under `#if ENG_VOICES > 1`. `arp_any_play()` (arp.c) is the clock-source test.
- Saved state: record version 2 with `BLOB_NV` 4 slots in both builds (the handoff's "version 3" was not needed). HELLO reply uses the defines; `DEVICE` in patchbin.ts is 255 / 128 (the one-voice build).
- `tools/pool_sizes.sh [-DENG_VOICES=4]` is the stand-in pool estimate (clang for riscv32 `-S` on modular.c, sums the `.size` of `.pool` symbols; runs on this Mac): one voice 302,338 B of 417,792 B (115 KB free; the granular buffer of 88 KB fits), four voices 408,482 B.

## New modules after the switch (host-tested: vitest 105, golden 73; not built with the JieLi toolchain, not flashed)

- `ladder` (4-pole ZDF ladder with a saturator in the loop, cv per block), osc `unison` / `detune` (patch format 11, `inst_t.s.osc.ph[4]`), `dyn` (peak follower + compressor; note `exp2_q16` returns a plain integer: add `16 << 16` for Q16), `math`, `logic`, `grain` (shared; `gr_pool` of `grain_line_t` = 1 s int16 + 8 grain records, `ENG_NGRAIN` 1 in the one-voice build, 0 with four voices). Formulas in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, each with a golden kit.
- `comb` (the string's line and `it->s.str`, shares `ENG_NSTRING`) and `modal` (six 2-pole resonators, Q30 coefficients; cos θ via `sin_turn30` and the half angle, a Q16 cosine detuned it by 1 %). Golden kits `comb`, `modal`.
- Main outputs `bend`, `mod`, `at` (shared; `pitch` includes the bend at ±2 st); `Engine.bend / cc / aftertouch`, worklet messages `bend` / `cc` / `at`, firmware `eng_ctl_v` + `midi_drain` (CC 1 mod, CC 16..19 knobs via `eng_find(T_FM1)`). The TS engine clamps its final output to ±1: test control outputs near 0.
- `shift` (Hilbert pair + quadrature oscillator; the sideband naming was verified by test, the formula's sign is the pair's convention). Stand-in pool with everything: 392,278 B (25 KB free).
- Golden lessons: anything that spawns events from an accumulator must use the same quantized increment in both engines (the grain's density increment is floored to 2^-24 in TS); a spawn inside a block must see the per-sample write index, not the block's start value.
- Stand-in pool (`tools/pool_sizes.sh`): 392,278 B of 417,792 B with the granular line (25 KB free). The four-voice build has no granular line (`ENG_NGRAIN` 0), 126 buffers and 92 instances (trimmed from 128 / 96 when `inst_t` grew), about 409 KB; `M1_VOICES=4 tools/golden.sh` skips the grain kit.

## Bypass + slider audit (host-tested: vitest 108, golden 74; not built with the JieLi toolchain, not flashed)

- Bypass: `ModuleInst.bypass`, `thruInput(def)` / `ModuleDef.thru` (mixer `in1`, xfade `a`, else the input named `in`, else mute), binary format 12 = bit 7 of the type byte (proto.c masks it with `M1_TYPE`), `def_t.thru`, engine.c `m_bypass`, protocol 0x22, editor ⏻ button (`bypassButton`, undo via `history`), FM-1 FX button (`bypass_toggle` in main.c; proto.c reaches the LCD through the `m1_ui_changed` hook since ui.c comes after it in modular.c). Assemblies: `bypassAssembly` (`AssemblyInst.bypass` / `kept`, the careful restore). Details in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md "Bypass".
- Slider audit: the editor's log sliders rounded to integers (`snapTo` now), cutoff max 16000, LFO rate and ADSR a/d/r log, delay time 1..520 (`DELAY_TIME_MIN/MAX`). Changing a log parameter's range changes how far a parameter input moves it (octaves of the range): the Pluck preset's K1 start was recomputed (test "knob routing leaves the sound").

## Issue sweep (2026-10-13, host-tested: vitest 131, golden 80 kits in both builds, arp + proto tests, LCD previews, Chrome checks; NOT built with the JieLi toolchain locally, not flashed)

All 20 issues of the fork (`glvno/Modular-1`) except #1 (device build and flash) were implemented on `dev`, in the order sound, editor, rest:

- Sound: filter outputs `notch` `peak` `ap` (#11); `os` oversampling on `shape` / `crush` (#14); `seq` `glide` / `gate` (#12); the reverb is an 8-line FDN (`RV_LINE`, 16 KB, #13); patch morphing (#4: `paramsB`, Main `morph` param + input, format 14, `morph_unit` / `morph_value`, mixer K2, CC 20); 23 factory assemblies + the `909 Kit` preset (#15, #18: the modal body needs a `hit` scale of 0.015..0.06 in front). Patch format is **15** (format 13: os + seq params; 14: morph B set after the cables, header flag bit 0; 15: macro range section after that, flag bit 1).
- Editor: macro ranges (#3: `ModuleInst.range`, `paramUnit` / `paramValue`, RANGE 0x23, `node_t.ranged` + `E.ranges`, LCD bracket); the arpeggiator in TS (#5: `web/src/arp.ts`, `Patch.arp`, ARP 0x24, INFO byte 5 = features, hook `m1_arp_set`); scope (#7: `Engine.probe`, worklet rings, `web/src/scope.ts`); diff + A/B (#8: `web/src/diff.ts`, `Editor.applyLive`); shortcuts + palette (#9, main.ts); mobile (#10: `Editor.zoom`, pinch / pan, long press); share links (#17: `web/src/share.ts`, `#p=`); factory patches carry an `assemblies` overlay (#19: five recipe assemblies; `patchbin.test` checks the binaries are unchanged).
- Rest: `.github/workflows/firmware.yml` (#2); the ENV performance page `PAGE_PERF` (#6); boot-safe mode `boot_safe` (#16); Pages enabled on the fork with the workflow on `dev` too (#20: https://glvno.github.io/Modular-1/; the `github-pages` environment needed a deployment branch policy for `dev`, added via the API, or the deploy job is rejected).
- `tools/build.py` rejects any immediate between 0xFFC00000 and 0xFFD00000 (it looks like a chip ROM address): a Q16 constant of -64 .. -48 trips it (the exponent clamp `-(60 << 16)` did; it is -(47 << 16) now). The real CI build: no warnings; pool 399,112 B (one voice, 18.7 KB free) / 401,224 B (four voices, 16.6 KB free): the stand-in overestimates the four-voice build by about 8 KB.
- Pool trims for the four-voice build on the way: `ENG_NBUF` 108, `ENG_MAX_INST` 72 (stand-in 8.8 KB free); one voice 18.7 KB free. `presets.h` must be regenerated after a format bump (it was stale at 14 once; the firmware CI now checks `export-defs` output is committed).
- Browser checks run against the user's own dev server on port 5173 (it serves this checkout); do not start a second one.
- Editor UX pass (2026-10-13, decided with the user): patch = complete sound (New patch = `newPatch(DEFS)`: Main + Output, deletable), assembly = building block (never Main / Output: editor filter + `stripPatchIO` in `validateAssemblyDef`); module select grouped by `MODULE_GROUPS` (main.ts) inserts on pick; `AssemblyBrowser` (browser.ts, shelves = `CATEGORIES` in assemblies.ts, `category` per `asm()` in gen-assemblies.ts, voice.json / echo.json by hand); one Library tab (`tab-library` holds the bank and the assemblies sections). The user wants the core-module / assembly distinction visible in the controls: a plain select for modules, a browser for assemblies; no merged "Add…" control.
- Shaper `sym` / `stages` (after the sweep): `shapeChain` / `shape_chain`, no state, patch format **16**, golden kit `wavefold` (81 kits).

## Slider ticks, knob colours, side pins (2026-10-14, browser-checked on the user's dev server; editor only)

- Slider thumb = the live (modulated) value from the engine; a tick in the secondary colour marks the base (`slider-jack.ts setBase`, `.slider-base`). A drag moves the base by the thumb's travel (`offset` in `paramRow`), so the live value stays under the pointer for additive routes; rows whose display is a product (VCA gain x cv, pan, mix, vowel) still settle part way back. The track is inset by half a thumb so min / max ticks sit flush with its ends.
- FM-1 knobs K1..K4 are colour coded in Sloop's hues (`--k1`..`--k4` in style.css, blue / green / yellow / orange; light and dark values): the Main card's k rows and output jacks (`data-knob`), the cables from them (`.cable.knob-kN`), and a tick under every slider a knob reaches (`web/src/knob-rest.ts knobRests`: cable from kN to a p1 / p2 pin via `att` + `map` or a macro range, to an `inputMap` route, or to a dedicated input via the new `ParamDef.rest` formula; only knobs that move the parameter off its base). `Editor.refreshKnobTicks` runs after `drawCables` and on every slider input (a knob or a base it rests on). The knob tick is centred on the track like the base tick, so a thumb over it hides it. Yellow and orange are close to the gate (gold) and audio (coral) cable colours.
- The p1 / p2 pins are in the input column with the other jacks (the `.pins` row and `Editor.pins` are gone).

## Tutorial course + permanent fixed links (2026-10-14, browser-checked on the user's dev server; editor only)

- A parameter's dedicated input (`ParamDef.input`: VCA cv, filter / ladder cutoff cv, morph, shift cv, pan / crossfade pos, vowel) is permanently linked: the route is drawn grey and inert (`.cable.alias.fixed`), `disabledInputs` is dropped by `validatePatch`, the encoder never writes format 17 / flag bit 2, the firmware still reads it. Golden kits `fixed-links`, `side-input-fanout`.
- `web/src/tutorial/`: `model.ts` (Step / Chapter types, `TutorialState`, `Actions`, patch helpers, `HeadlessSession` + `runCourse`), `chapters.ts` (the 11 chapters; `courseRun()` memoizes the headless run: canned starts / ends, bundled copies of the five saved assemblies; `tutorialDef(tag, name, library)` = the user's by tag, then name, else bundled), `tutorial.ts` (panel, chapter menu, progress in localStorage `matryoshka.tutorial`, 400 ms poll, target highlight, Actions adapter), `tutorial.test.ts`. Design: docs/TUTORIAL.md. The old `tour.ts` is gone; `starter.ts` stays as the first-run patch.
- Step flags: `transient` (editor state / counters, skipped when judging whether a patch continues a chapter), `superseded` (a later step of the chapter undoes it: not re-checked, not re-applied). `completes(ch, patch, lib)` is that judgement. Every apply must be idempotent-by-check (the runtime and tests skip apply when the check already passes).
- Host hooks in main.ts: `tutorial.noteOn / undone / redone / zoomed / flipped / shared / bypassed`, `EditorEvents.onHistory`, `Editor.transact / selectOnly`, `AssemblyDef.tutorial` tag, `bank.addToBank`. Examples picker has a "Tutorial" optgroup = `chapterEnd(i)`.
- The scope traces nothing on its own any more (the automatic output traces are gone from scope.ts and the worklet): it starts hidden, appears with the first ◎ probe, and shows a hint when it has none.
- Every chapter loads its canned start (`chapterStart(i)`; `Chapter.keep` and the "Continuing with your patch" branch are gone, 2026-10-14): the user's work never carries into the next chapter, so no difference can accumulate against the checks. The open patch goes to the bank first unless its name starts with "Tutorial" (a patch the user made with New patch during a chapter is renamed to the chapter's `patchName` when a step completes). Chapter 1 starts bare too: its New patch step is transient and counts the press (`Seen.news`, `Actions.newPatch`, `tutorial.newPatchPressed()` from both New patch handlers in main.ts); a full patch as its start made the moot rule skip it.
- `stepDone(ch, i, s)` (model.ts): a step is done when its check holds or, for a transient / superseded step, when a later structural step of the chapter holds ("already in the patch, moving on"), so re-walking a finished patch runs through.
- A done step auto-advances after `ADVANCE_MS` (900 ms); Back holds the previous step (`hold`) and shows Next instead.
- A step's check is a list of named parts (`need(...)` in chapters.ts: `cable`, `gone`, `added`, `knob`, `promoted` helpers), each with its own elements, labelled as an imperative to the user ("Cable Main gate → VCA cv", "Set cutoff to 800 Hz or below"; the helpers add the verb): the panel lists the unmet parts under the text ("Still to do") and highlights the first unmet one (`Step.focus`), so a locked Next always says why and points where. A panel with nothing to sit beside (intro, chapter done, welcome) is centred on the screen.
- Interior routes (the user's own, `.cable.alias`) get an invisible `.cable-hit` path 1.5x the stroke on top of the card's controls (`.internal-cables` z-index 3); the visible path takes no pointer events. The scope's default corner is the top right.
- The panel places itself beside the step's first target (right, left, below, above; never over any highlighted element; `Tutorial.place`), follows it each poll tick, and stays where the user dragged it until the target changes. The highlight is re-applied every tick because the editor rebuilds its cards.
- Chapter 1 puts a gated VCA in front of the Output before any audio reaches it (test: silent without a key after every step); the Output's default `level` is 0.15 for the same reason (defs.h regenerated; engine tests that need the old loudness pin 0.7; the `fixed-links` golden kit was made louder since its chain sat at the Q16 floor).
- Focus policy (`web/src/focus.ts`): after a pointer interaction the focused control is blurred (on the frame after pointerup; a select on change), so Space / arrows / Delete go to the app's shortcuts, not the control; typing fields, open dialogs and Tab-reached focus keep it. The focus ring is `:focus-visible` only.
- Grouping is Ctrl/Cmd+G (plain G is a note key; it was G when nothing was selected).
- A VCA with nothing plugged into cv is closed (both engines; `m_vca` reads the zero buffer, modules.ts no longer treats an unconnected cv as 1). No factory patch or assembly had an unplugged VCA cv; tests and golden kits that did now feed a Constant of 1.
- Lesson: an apply that deletes a module must use `removeModule` (cables too) or the engine throws on a dangling cable.

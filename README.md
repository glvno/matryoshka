# Matryoshka

A recursively modular and **FM1**-friendly synth framework, with a browser patch editor and reusable, nested assemblies.

**Modules** are the building blocks -- a single oscillator, a VCA, a filter, a delay, whatever.

**Assemblies** are groups of modules. The provided "operator" assembly, for example, is a single oscillator, an eight-step envelope, and a VCA. Like presets, they can be saved and reused. Did you build a really perverted granular synth that sounds like the voice of the metatron? Select its modules, save it as an assembly, and now that's an instrument you can use in your presets whenever you want.

Assembly inputs, outputs, and sliders are just whatever inputs, outputs, and sliders from its contained modules you want to promote to being part of the assembly's user interface.

A handful of patch presets are provided. Use them to learn, then replace them with something you made.


## Webapp

[Open the Matryoshka editor](https://glvno.github.io/matryoshka/) to make patches and upload them to the FM-1. The editor deploys from branch `main`; its firmware package has not been installed on a device. The [original Modular-1 editor](https://wiggismodular.github.io/Modular-1/) is also available.

Start with **How a patch works** in the sidebar: play a four-module voice, trace the signals, and turn the voice into an assembly. Browser audio is enabled automatically; a fresh browser may wait for your first interaction. Enabling the arpeggiator plays only held keys.

The wordmark uses Roboto Flex capitals, with a teal M and a full-height “1” forming the R’s stem. The logo pairs coral and yellow parent dolls with two teal siblings and matching cable arms. The selected wordmark and editable settings are in the [type lab](https://glvno.github.io/matryoshka/brand/round-four/index.html?preset=p13). The lab also has independent spacing for all nine letter pairs and left/right T-arm and numeral-foot controls, saved in shared links and SVG exports. Earlier [wordmark and pictorial studies](https://glvno.github.io/matryoshka/brand/round-two/index.html), [ten candidates](https://glvno.github.io/matryoshka/brand/candidates/index.html), and [UX proposals](https://glvno.github.io/matryoshka/review/index.html) remain available.

The sidebar holds the logo (with ♥ About, the theme toggle and the collapse button in its corner), **Patch / Library** navigation, the patch name, **New patch**, **+ Module** / **+ Assembly**, the canvas controls and the example picker. What the last action did (audio running, link copied, load failed) shows in the status line under the keyboard. The **⋯** in the PATCH header (**Patch ⋯** in the mobile bar) shares a link, saves or loads a .json, stores to an FM-1 slot, opens FM-1 & MIDI and deletes a saved patch; the **FM-1** chip in the status line shows the connection and opens FM-1 & MIDI. **Commands** (Ctrl/Cmd+K) opens file operations, undo/redo, grouping, hardware settings, firmware installation, and help. The palette opens on actions; its Modules, Assemblies and Patches filters let you browse without guessing a name. On narrow screens, **Workspace** opens a sidebar drawer. **Tab** moves through controls.

Slider thumbs are input jacks: **drag normally to adjust, Alt-drag to patch**, or drop an output cable onto a thumb. External cables plug into side jacks, which route to the moving thumbs through internal cables. **Click an internal cable to disconnect that parameter**, leaving the incoming cable and other destinations intact. **Drag the same side input to several thumbs to add multiple destinations** (or Alt-drag from the thumb to the side input). Thumb positions pause while patching so the targets stay still.

Open the **⋯** menu beside a parameter for p1/p2 routing, modulation depth, macro ranges and K1–K4 hardware assignments. Any side input can also feed additional parameters; these extra routes add the signal’s block average across the parameter range. Dedicated controls use their own input (for example, Filter cutoff uses `cv`). Other thumbs reuse a suitable p1/p2 route or allocate an unused input; the editor reports when both are occupied. Depth is shared by every parameter assigned to that input. K1–K4 assignments apply while that module is selected on the FM-1.

### Voices

A patch is mono unless you pick a voice count (2..8) on the Main module's card (or on the FM-1: GLO opens the mixer, where the ALGORITHM encoder sets the polyphony of the patch, SAVE keeps it). Like on the Nord Modular you don't patch the voices yourself: every module that hears the Main module's pitch, gate or vel (through any chain of cables, p1 / p2 included) runs once per voice, marked `×4` on its card. Delay, reverb and output always run once and receive the sum of the voices; a module that hears no voice signal (a free-running LFO, a noise) runs once and feeds every voice. Notes take a free voice first, then the oldest sounding one. On the FM-1 each voice costs the CPU time of the per-voice modules, so 3 or 4 voices of a typical patch is the realistic range; the voices row on the Main card shows the buffer count and turns red when a patch needs more than the firmware has.

The firmware plays one patch at a time (the default build). The four-patch firmware of upstream 1.0.2, where the panel calls the four patches voices 1..4 (SEL switches between them, each with its own MIDI channel, arpeggiator and mixer level, the pools shared between them), is a build switch: `M1_VOICES=4 python3 tools/build.py`.

## FM-1

> **Coming from Felucca?** Matryoshka keeps its patches in flash sectors that Felucca uses for its projects, samples and user presets (0x97000, 0x98000, 0xA0000-0xDFFFF). Its first start writes the 64 factory patches there (that erases almost all of those sectors) and every SAVE writes there again, so the Felucca data in them is lost. Save them with Felucca before you install; the Flash tab asks again when the FM-1 reports a Felucca identity. Patches stored by the official M-VAVE firmware are not touched.

In addition to the modular synth engine, there's also a deep arpeggiator.

Knobs and stuff.

* **PRESETS** scrolls trough the patches
* **SELECT** scrolls trough the modules in the patch
* **KNOB1 - 4** do what's described
* **ARP** opens the arpeggiator's melody page (mode, rate, octaves, speed)
* **SEQ** opens the arpeggiator's rhythm page (euclid steps, pulses, rotation, rate)
* **LFO** opens arpeggiator's chaos page, adds some randomness and lets select how many octaves the arpeggio spans.
* **HOME** opens the main page of the patch
* **ENV** opens the performance page: the four knob destinations with big values and bars, the patch strip with bypassed modules dim, and one line with the arpeggiator's state, the polyphony, the octave and how many modules are off. K1–K4 turn the Main module's knobs there; ENV again goes back.
* **SAVE held at power-on** boots in safe mode: the stored state is skipped and the factory patch plays (`SAFE MODE: STATE SKIPPED`); the state stays in flash for the next normal boot, MENU > SYSTEM > DEFAULTS erases it. A boot that did not get through makes the next one safe by itself; two in a row still go to the update loader.
* **GLO** opens the mixer: K1 sets the level, the black key F# mutes, ALGORITHM sets the polyphony (the patch reloads with the new count). Four-voice build: K1-K4 and F# G# A# C# for the four voices (patches), ALGORITHM acts on the selected one
* **SEL** switches to the next voice (patch) in the four-voice build; keys, knobs, LCD and the editor act on it. Unused in the one-voice build

## Hack it

- Run it yourself: `cd web && npm install && npm run dev`
- Edit tutorial writing locally: choose **Edit lesson writing** in the dev app sidebar, or open <http://localhost:5173/lesson-editor>. Save writes the lesson source; it does not publish. See [the lesson editor guide](docs/TUTORIAL.md#writing-lessons-locally).
- Build the firmware: `nix develop`, then `python3 tools/build.py`

## Assemblies

**Ctrl/Cmd+K** searches the command palette directly: `module` lists modules, `assembly` lists factory and saved assemblies alongside assembly actions, and `assembly drums` or `assembly kick` narrows the list. Names, type tags, shelves and the modules / ports inside a prefab are searchable. Arrow keys select a result; Enter inserts it without opening the assembly browser.

A **patch** is a complete sound: it starts from Main and Output ("New patch" in the toolbar's patch select) and is what the bank and the FM-1 hold. An **assembly** is a building block: a group of prewired modules that appears as one card with the ports and parameters it exposes: an "operator" of oscillator, envelope and VCA, a whole subtractive voice, an echo. Select modules in the editor (shift-click, or drag a box on the canvas) and click **Make assembly**: the ports that had cables to the outside become the card's ports (Main and Output never join: they stay outside, and a `.json` with them in loses them). **open** shows the modules inside a frame, where ○ / ● next to a port or a parameter puts it on the card; drag cards into or out of the frame to change what belongs to it. **save** puts the assembly into the library (your shelf of the **Insert assembly** browser and of the Library page), from where it can be inserted into any patch, exported as a `.json` file and imported again. Forty-three come with the editor, on the shelves Drums, Voices, Effects, Textures and Utilities.

Assemblies are an editor-only overlay: the patch stays a flat list of modules and cables, the FM-1 receives it unchanged, and an older editor loads such a patch and only loses the grouping. Knob assignments (K1..K4) are not part of a saved assembly, since the knobs belong to the patch. Ctrl/Cmd+Z undoes structural changes, Shift redoes.

## Sync, glide, shaper, spread

- The Oscillator and the LFO have a `sync` input: a rising edge (the Main gate, a square LFO, anything above 0.5) restarts the phase. Main `gate` into an oscillator's `sync` gives every note the same attack, the way FM synths do; one oscillator's output into another's `sync` is hard sync.
- **Glide** is a one-pole slew for any control: Main `pitch` through a Glide into the oscillator is portamento; `time` is how long a step takes to get within 1 %.
- **Shaper** drives a signal into a soft clip (smooth up to the knee), a hard clip or a triangle fold, with the peak kept at 1 and a `level` after it. It is the drive for a bass and the safety for a hot FM carrier. `sym` shifts the signal before the curve, so one half folds or clips more than the other: even harmonics, and a DC part that a high pass after it removes. `stages` runs the curve one to four times with a gain of 2 between: in `fold` mode a denser wavefolder (the folds fold again), in the clip modes cascaded gain stages. `os` runs it 2x oversampled: the harmonics above 22 kHz are filtered out instead of folding back as inharmonic grit (about 2.3x the CPU of the module; off by default).
- The Main panel has a `spread` output: a constant per voice from -1 (first voice) to 1 (last), 0 in mono. Into an oscillator's `p1` with `fine` ticked it detunes the voices into a unison pad; into two VCAs with opposite attenuverters it pans them.


## Level/rate envelope, string, wavetable, chorus

- **Env L/R** is the DX7 envelope: on a gate it runs to `l1`, `l2`, `l3` in `r1`, `r2`, `r3`, holds `l3`, and releases to `l4` in `r4`. Rising segments are linear (the rate that covers 0..1 in `r`), falling ones exponential (99 % in `r`). Put it on a VCA for percussion, and through a Scale on an oscillator's `pitch` for a drum's pitch drop.
- **String** is a plucked string (Karplus-Strong). Main `pitch` and `gate` play it: a `gate` fires a one-period burst of `noise` or a `pulse` into a loop that decays to −60 dB in `decay`; `damp` darkens it. Anything into `exc` plucks or rings it too, so a short oscillator click is a different pick, and a steady signal makes it a tuned resonator. Lowest note 40 Hz; the FM-1 has 8 string lines (6 in the four-voice build, shared by its voices).
- **Wavetable** is an oscillator with four banks of eight single-cycle frames (`analog`: sine, triangle, saw, square, pulses; `organ`: drawbar sets; `formant`: a moving bump of harmonics; `digital`: steps and corners). `pos` sweeps the frames with crossfades; an LFO into `p1` on `pos` is the classic wavetable sweep. It has `pm` and `sync` like the Oscillator (the FM path is not oversampled), and it is band-limited in three steps so high notes stay clean.
- **Chorus** is a stereo chorus (two taps in quadrature around 12 ms, swept up to ±8 ms) with `l` and `r` outputs for the Output. Like the Delay it runs once for all voices; one per patch on the FM-1.

## Sequencer, clock divider, S&H, quantizer, pulse

- **Sequencer**: eight steps (`s1`..`s8`, −1..1), `len` and `dir` (forward, backward, pendulum, random). A rising edge on `clock` moves on, `reset` goes back to step 1. `out` is the current step all the time, `gate` follows the clock while the step is not a rest; a step turned fully down is a rest. A square LFO is a clock; Main `gate` into `reset` restarts the pattern on every key. `glide` slews `out` from step to step (the time is that fraction of the clock period, so it follows the tempo; 0 = steps), `gate` sets the gate length as a fraction of the period (0 = the clock's own width, 1 = legato: the steps tie and an ADSR does not retrigger). Both measure the period from the last two clock edges.
- **Clock div**: `out` passes every `div`-th clock pulse, `d2` `d4` `d8` every 2nd, 4th and 8th; `reset` makes the next pulse a downbeat.
- **S&H**: `out` takes `in` on a clock edge (`hold`) or follows it while the clock is up (`track`). Noise into a clocked S&H into a Quantizer is a random melody.
- **Quantizer**: snaps a pitch to the nearest note of a scale on a root (chromatic, major, minor, pentatonics, dorian, mixolydian, blues, whole tone, fifths, octaves). Put it after a Sequencer, an S&H, a Glide or an LFO into `pitch`.
- **Pulse**: a trigger in, a gate of `time` out; a new trigger restarts it. It turns a short clock tick into a gate long enough for an envelope's attack, or a long gate into a short one.
## Pan, crossfade, vowel, phaser, digitizer, noise colour

- **Pan** places a signal with an equal-power law; its `pos` input adds to the `pan` knob, so Main `spread` into it spreads the voices across the stereo field and an LFO autopans.
- **Crossfade** fades between `a` and `b` by `mix` + `pos` (an envelope or an LFO on `pos`).
- **Vowel** is three band passes at the formants of A E I O U; `vowel` morphs between them (0..4), the input adds to it, `res` is the sharpness.
- **Phaser** sweeps four allpass stages ±2 `depth` octaves around `center` at `rate`, with `fb` and `mix`.
- **Digitizer** reduces the bit depth (`bits`) and the sample rate (`rate` = every sample held that many times). `os` as on the Shaper: the steps are rounded off at twice the rate before coming back down, so the images of the held samples alias less.
- **Noise** has a `color` parameter: 0 is white, 1 rolls the top off from about 220 Hz.
## Unison

- The **Oscillator** has `unison` (1..5 copies) and `detune` (cents, spread from −detune to +detune): a supersaw or a thick pulse from one module, summed so the peak stays at `level`. Sync restarts all copies. With `pm` connected or `fb` above 0 the oscillator runs its FM path, which plays one copy.

## Frequency shifter

- **Freq shift** moves every partial by the same number of Hz (not a pitch shift: harmonics become inharmonic): `up` and `down` outputs, `shift` ±1000 Hz with `cv` × `cvamt`, `mix`. A few Hz for a slow barber-pole phasing, hundreds for bells and clangs out of a saw.

## Performance controls

During browser playback, sliders and their readouts follow dedicated CV inputs (including filter cutoff and VCA envelopes), parameter-input modulation, macro ranges and patch morphing, including parameters exposed on assembly cards. A moving value uses the teal accent; hover it to see its saved base value. Dragging or using the keyboard edits that base value, and animation resumes when you release the control. Fast modulation is sampled as often as the display can update. Polyphonic parameters show the newest held note (or its release when no notes are held). These displays follow the browser engine; the FM-1 does not send live parameter telemetry back.

- Pitch bend moves the Main module's `pitch` by ±2 semitones in every patch; the wheel is also a `bend` output (−1..1). The mod wheel (CC 1) is the `mod` output, channel aftertouch the `at` output: patch them into any `p1` / `p2`. CC 16..19 turn the Main module's K1..K4 from a controller. During browser playback, the Main sliders follow incoming CC values.

## Comb filter and modal resonator

- **Comb** is a tuned feedback comb: a delay of one period of the `pitch` (plus `coarse`) with `fb` (positive: a peak at every harmonic; negative: the odd ones, hollow) and `damp`, mixed by `mix`. A flanger with an LFO on `pitch`, a resonator on noise, a Karplus string without the pluck.
- **Modal** is a resonator of six partials at the `pitch`: harmonic at `struct` 0, a metal bar at 1; `decay` is the ring time, `damp` shortens the upper partials, `bright` their level. Hit it with a short burst (a pulse, a gated noise, a plucked string) for bells, bars and drums; a steady input makes it howl.

## Granular

- **Granular** records whatever is patched into it (one second, `freeze` stops the recording) and plays grains from it: `density` grains per second or one per rising edge on `trig`, each reading `size` seconds from `position` back in the buffer (0 = the newest audio) scattered by `spray`, at `pitch` semitones, under a smooth window, up to eight at once, mixed with the input by `mix`. A frozen chord into a cloud, a stutter from a square LFO on `trig`, a pitch-shifted echo. One per patch on the FM-1 (not in the four-voice build).

## Math and logic

- **Math** takes two signals (`a` scaled by `ka` plus `off`, `b` scaled by `kb`) and outputs their sum, difference, product, min, max, |a| and a gate that is high while a > b: ring modulation, a CV mixer, a comparator, a rectifier.
- **Logic** combines two gates: `and`, `or`, `xor`, `not` (of `a`), high from `thresh` on. Two clocks into `xor` make a rhythm.

## Compressor

- **Compressor** is an envelope follower and compressor in one: `env` outputs the follower (a control: an oscillator's loudness as a CV, a sidechain pump from a kick into a VCA), `out` the signal compressed above `thresh` by `ratio` with `attack`, `release` and makeup `gain`. The `side` input is the sidechain; without it the detector listens to `in`.

## On a phone or tablet

- One finger on empty canvas pans; cards drag by their header. Pinch and Ctrl/Cmd+wheel still scale the canvas, with Fit and Reset available through Commands. On touch screens the jacks and controls are larger, and a long press on a card header opens its actions. Below 700 px, the sidebar becomes a dismissible Workspace drawer, leaving the full width for the patch. Web MIDI over USB works on Android Chrome in principle; the FM-1 link from a phone has not been tried.

## Share a patch as a link

- **Commands → Share patch link** copies a link that opens this patch: the JSON, layout and assemblies included, deflated into the URL fragment (`#p=…`, about 800 characters for a factory patch). Opening the link loads the patch into the editor without replacing the patch the browser remembers until you change something; the Patches page has an "Import link" field that puts a linked patch into the bank list. A patch too big for a link (over 8000 characters) travels without its card positions and assembly overlay, and opens on a grid.

## Community patches

- The Library tab opens with **Community patches**: patches players shared, each with its author, the licence (CC BY-SA 4.0), its age, its notes, its engines and whether it plays on the FM-1. **Open** loads one like a patch link (nothing is saved until you save it); **↗** opens the post. The Open picker lists them under Community.
- **Post yours** opens the [issue form](https://github.com/glvno/matryoshka/issues/new?template=community-patch.yml) filled in with the open patch's link; **More on r/MVaveFM1** searches the subreddit for posts with a patch link.
- The list is `web/src/community.json`, bundled with the app (no server). Accepted submissions are added to it in a commit, one entry each (`title`, `author`, `licence: "CC-BY-SA-4.0"`, `source`: the Reddit post or the issue, `code`: the link's `#p=` value, `added`: YYYY-MM-DD, optional `notes`); `community.test.ts` decodes every entry and fails on a broken code or a missing author or licence.

## Diff

- **Edit → Show changes** lists what changed since the patch was last loaded, uploaded or stored on the FM-1: parameters as old → new, modules and cables added or removed, and switches, attenuverters, parameter routing, macro ranges, voices and arpeggiator changes as one line each.

## Keyboard

- `/` or Ctrl/Cmd+K opens a **command palette**: type part of a name to add a module, insert an assembly (library or factory), load a patch or start a new one; Enter runs the first match, arrows choose. `?` lists every shortcut.
- Note keys keep playing after using a dropdown, checkbox, slider or button. A closed dropdown keeps focus but does not use note keys to select another option. Open dropdowns, text fields and dialogs keep their normal keyboard behavior; arrows and Tab still navigate controls. Z / X change octave.
- Click a jack, then a jack of the other kind, to connect them (Esc cancels; dragging works as before). With cards selected (shift-click or a box): Delete removes them, B bypasses them, G groups them into an assembly, Ctrl/Cmd+D duplicates them with their settings and the cables among them, the arrows nudge them (Shift: ×10). Space starts and stops the arpeggiator, Ctrl/Cmd+Z and Shift+Ctrl/Cmd+Z undo and redo. The shortcuts are off while a text field has focus; the note keys (A W S E D F T G Y H U J K) still play when they are not taken.

## Scope

Add a **Scope** module and cable up to two signals into its `a` and `b` inputs; its screen sits on the card (and on an assembly card that shows it). Hover the screen for its buttons: the time window (− / +), Wave or FFT, and Voices (one trace per voice, when the source runs once per voice). Audio waveforms auto-scale and trigger on a rising crossing; the spectrum is a 2048-point Hann-windowed FFT. The Scope runs only in the browser: it is left out of what goes to the FM-1.

## Arpeggiator in the editor

- The FM-1's arpeggiator (MELODY / RHYTHM / CHAOS pages) is on the Main card too, under **Arpeggiator**: mode, scale (the device's 67 scales and chords), root, bpm, rate, Euclidean steps / pulses / rotation, octaves and the three chaos amounts, plus a **play** switch. The browser runs the same arpeggiator (the same clock, modes, random generator and 65 % gate), so a patch grooves the same way on both. The settings are saved with the patch (`arp` in the JSON; the binary patch does not carry them) and reach the FM-1 with every upload and with every change (the ARP command); play starts and stops the device's arpeggiator as the PLAY button does. A patch without the section leaves the FM-1's settings alone.

## Macro ranges

- A parameter input normally *adds* to a parameter: p1 at 1 moves it up by the attenuverter's share of its range. A **macro range** makes the input *set* it between two ends instead: in the parameter’s **⋯** routing menu, enable **Map between two values** under p1 or p2 to show the two ends (as values; for a logarithmic parameter the travel is in octaves). One Main knob into p1 of the filter and of the envelope then opens the cutoff from 200 Hz to 8 kHz while it shortens the decay from 0.5 s to 50 ms, each over its own travel; swapped ends make a knob go down. The slider's own value is ignored while a range is set; the attenuverter scales the travel, the input is clamped to 0..1 (for a bipolar LFO put a Scale with offset 0.5 in front). The ranges travel with the patch (binary format 15) and live edits reach the FM-1 (RANGE command); the LCD draws the travel as a bracket over the knob row's bar.

## Patch morphing

- A patch can carry a **B side**: the parameters of another stored patch with the same modules and cables. Pick it on the Main card ("B side": the Library page and the factory list are offered, only those of the same structure), then the Main module's `morph` slider fades every parameter from this patch (A, at 0) to the other (B, at 1): linearly, in octaves for a logarithmic one (a cutoff morphs musically), a choice or a switch flips at the midpoint. Notes keep sounding while you morph: only the parameters move. The Main module has a `morph` input as well; it adds to the slider, so an LFO, an envelope or a sequencer can morph the patch (block rate, one block late). On the FM-1 the mixer page's K2 is the morph (one-voice build) and CC 20 sets it; the B side travels with the patch (binary format 14) and is saved with it. To get a B side: save the patch under a second name, change its sounds, come back to the first and pick the copy.

## Reverb


- The **Reverb** is an eight-line feedback network (dense from the first reflections on, no metallic ring thanks to a slow modulation of two of its lines). `size` is the decay: 0.2 s at 0 to 6.4 s at 1 (60 dB), `damp` rolls off the highs in the tail, `pre` holds the tail back by up to 40 ms so the attack stays clear, `mod` is the chorusing of the tail (0 for a static, perfectly repeatable tail), `mix` the wet share. One per patch, like the Delay. Old patches keep their size / damp / mix and get the new tail.

## Filter: notch, peak, allpass

- The **Filter** has three more outputs after `mix`: `notch` (a null at the cutoff, the rest passes: the opposite of `bp`), `peak` (flat, with a resonant bump at the cutoff set by `res`: a parametric boost) and `ap` (allpass: everything passes, the phase turns through 360° around the cutoff; summed with `in` it is a phaser stage, modulated and summed with the dry signal a one-stage phaser). They come from the same two integrators, so they cost nothing extra when unused.

## Ladder filter


- **Ladder** is a four-pole low pass of the Moog kind with `drive`: four one-pole stages in a feedback loop with a soft saturator inside it, so `res` goes up to self-oscillation (at 1) and `drive` (1..8) pushes the signal into the saturator for grit. Outputs `lp24` and `lp12`; `cv` with `cvamt` and `track` as on the Filter. Its cutoff modulation is updated once per block (fine for envelopes and LFOs; the Filter is the one for audio-rate cutoff).

## Assemblies: merged ports, placement, nesting

- **Merged ports.** On an expanded assembly, every exposed input has a `merge…` list of the card's other inputs of the same kind. Merging turns two jacks into one that feeds both (the factory `voice` has one `gate` for its two envelopes); the card shows `×2` and a `split` button. A cable into a merged jack goes to every input behind it, and removing it takes them all.
- **Placement.** "Add module" (a select by kind; picking inserts) and "Insert assembly" (a browser: shelves on the left, entries with their ports on the right, a search across all) put the new card on the first free grid cell instead of on top of what is there.
- **Nesting.** An assembly can hold assemblies, three levels deep: select modules inside an expanded assembly and "Make assembly", or drop a collapsed card into an expanded frame. The parent's card may show whatever its children expose; collapsing the parent hides everything inside. Ungroup dissolves one level, delete keeps the nested ones. Saved assemblies carry their nested ones.

## Factory assemblies

The browser's factory shelves hold forty-three, made by `web/scripts/gen-assemblies.ts` (edit the script, rerun it, commit the files; `voice` and `echo` are kept by hand):

- The recipes of the factory patches: **filter voice** (oscillator, filter, one ADSR on the VCA, the filter's cv exposed), **adsr operator** (oscillator into a VCA with an ADSR: the operator of the FM patches), **noise voice**, **stack voice** (two oscillators, mixer, filter, ADSR, VCA, with `in3` for a third oscillator), **vibrato** (LFO through a Scale). The factory patches open as their instrument's assembly card (Init stays flat); the overlay is editor-only, so the sound and the binary patch are unchanged, and a patch saved from the editor keeps its grouping in the JSON and the bank while the FM-1 and the binary form drop it.

- Voices: **operator** (oscillator, level/rate envelope, VCA: an FM operator, with `pm` in and `level cv`), **fm pair** (a modulator with its own envelope into a carrier: one `pitch`, one `gate`), **voice** (subtractive: oscillator, filter, two ADSRs), **sub bass** (glide, square an octave down, dark tracking filter), **wavetable pad** (slow frame sweep, filter, slow ADSR), **vowel voice** (saw through the vowel filter swept by an LFO), **pluck** (string into a tracking low pass).
- Drums (no samples: modal bodies, noise and envelopes): **kick** (sine with a pitch drop, a 1 ms click, decay envelope, drive), **snare** (noise through a high pass plus a sine body), **hihat** (noise through a high pass, very short), **hats** (a detuned square cluster plus noise through a 7 kHz high pass: `gate` is the closed hat, `open` the open one, and the closed hat chokes the open one), **clap** (a noise band with a flam and a tail), **rim** (a strike into a short inharmonic body and a tuned comb), **cowbell** (two squares a sixth apart, band pass, short envelope), **tom** (a harmonic modal body with a pitch drop; `tune` picks the size), **tabla** (a slightly inharmonic head with a slap; velocity opens `bright`, a slow envelope bends the pitch down). All take one `gate`; the drums ignore pitch (tabla takes it), so one key per drum through a Sequencer's gate or the Main gate. The factory patch **909 Kit** plays kick, snare and hihat from three sequencers on one clock; the **808 Kit** plays the **boom kick** (a long, low sine with a shallow drop, no click), snare, hihat and cowbell the same way.
- Instruments (factory assemblies built after famous synthesizers, each with a factory patch of the same name): **Oracle V** (Prophet-5), **Monolith D** (Minimoog Model D), **Silver Box** (TB-303), **Hera 6** (Juno-106), **Sallen 20** (MS-20), **Expander S** (Oberheim SEM / Four Voice), **Algo Four** (4-operator DX / TX FM), **Canvas** (Buchla Music Easel), **Wanderer** (ARP Odyssey). The names point at the originals; nothing is affiliated with their makers.
- Granular (one Granular per patch): **cloud** (a dense pitch-true cloud of whatever comes in; `freeze` and play over it), **shimmer** (the reverb's tail fed back through grains an octave up; holds the patch's Reverb), **stutter** (grains fired by an internal divided clock, the read position jumping), **time smear** (a feedback delay into grains an octave down, crossfaded with the dry signal; holds the patch's Delay), **slicer** (a step sequencer picks the read position of the last second, its gate fires the grain), **reverse pad** (long grains from `age` seconds back under a slow attack).
- Modal: **glass bell** (a strike into a bar-like body with a little frequency shift; velocity opens `bright`), **gamelan** (two bar bodies a fifth apart, the second a little sharp, one noise burst), **kalimba** (a plucked tine with a comb body), **marimba** (a bar with a resonator tube by `tube` and a tremolo `motor` for vibes), **bowed glass** (noise through a tracking ladder into a modal body under a slow envelope, a compressor evens the sustain), **rain** (a fast random clock samples noise into a pentatonic pitch and strikes a body), **resonator bank** (three bodies on the root, fifth and octave: a drone from a chord, tuned percussion from a drum loop). Their `hit` parameter is the strike level: the modal body rings loud, so a strike of 0.02..0.06 is the range.
- Comb, shifter, compressor: **bowed string** (noise through a ladder into a high-feedback comb at the pitch, glide), **barber pole** (a slow frequency shift up and down crossfaded by an LFO: an endless rise), **sidechain pump** (a compressor ducked by an internal clock's pulse), **talking filter** (the input's envelope opens the vowel).
- Sequencing: **clock** (square LFO with /2 /4 /8 /div), **step sequencer** (clock, eight steps, quantizer: `pitch` and `gate` out, add its `pitch` to Main's into an oscillator), **random melody** (clocked S&H on noise, quantizer, pulse gate).
- Utilities: **auto pan** (LFO on a Pan: `in` to `l` `r`), **echo** (delay into reverb).


## Module on / off

Every module except Main and Output has a power button in its card header: off, the module is bypassed like a device in a DAW rack. Its main input (`in`, the mixer's `in1`, the crossfade's `a`) goes straight to every output, so a filter, delay, reverb, shaper or compressor drops out of the chain without a repatch; a module without such an input (an oscillator, LFO or envelope) is muted. The module keeps its state and resumes when turned on again. On the FM-1 the FX button toggles the selected module; the switch is saved with the patch. An assembly has the same button: it switches every module inside, and remembers the ones you had switched off yourself so they stay off when the group comes back.
